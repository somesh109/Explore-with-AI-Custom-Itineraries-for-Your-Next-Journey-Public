# Explore-with-AI-Custom-Itineraries-for-Your-Next-Journey-Public
Explore with AI is a smart travel planning application designed to generate customized travel itineraries based on simple user inputs. The system focuses on three main inputs: destination, number of days, and number of nights. Using these details, the application automatically creates a structured and easy-to-follow travel plan. The main purpose of this project is to simplify trip planning and provide users with a ready-made itinerary without spending hours researching online.

Project Objective

The objective of this project is to build an intelligent system that helps travelers plan their trips quickly and efficiently. Instead of manually searching for places to visit, the user only needs to enter the destination along with the duration of stay (days and nights). Based on this information, the application generates a well-organized travel schedule that covers important attractions and activities.

How the System Works

The working of the system is simple and user-friendly:

The user enters the destination they want to visit.

The user selects the number of days and nights for the trip.

The AI processes this information.

The system generates a detailed day-wise travel itinerary.

For example, if a user selects “Paris” for 3 days and 2 nights, the system will create a schedule such as:

Day 1: Major attractions and sightseeing

Day 2: Cultural spots and local experiences

Day 3: Relaxation and shopping activities

This structured output helps users understand how to spend their time effectively during the trip.
